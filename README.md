# Time-Series-SARIMAX-Model
The SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors) model is an extension of the ARIMA model that incorporates seasonal effects and external variables. It is particularly useful for time series data that exhibit seasonal patterns and trends, making it suitable for applications such as temperature forecasting.

# Components of SARIMAX
* Seasonal Component (S): Captures periodic patterns in the data (e.g., yearly, monthly).
* Autoregressive Component (AR): Models the relationship between current and past values.
* Integrated Component (I): Differencing to achieve stationarity.
* Moving Average Component (MA): Models the dependency between an observation and past error terms.
* Exogenous Variables (X): Allows for the inclusion of external factors that may influence the time series.
  
# Steps to Implement SARIMAX on Temperature Data
 1) Data Preparation:
    Load the Time_Series_Temp_Data.csv dataset and ensure it is structured correctly with a datetime index.
 2) Stationarity Check:
    Use the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to check if the time series is stationary. If not, apply differencing.
 3) Differencing:
    Apply seasonal differencing if necessary to stabilize the mean of the time series.
 4) Parameter Identification:
    Analyze ACF and PACF plots to determine suitable values for p, d, q, and seasonal parameters.
 5) Model Fitting:
   Fit the SARIMAX model using identified parameters.
 6) Model Evaluation:
    Evaluate model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
 7) Forecasting:
    Use the fitted model to forecast future temperature values.

# Example Implementation in Python
  Here’s a sample code snippet demonstrating how to apply the SARIMAX model to the temperature dataset:
python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from statsmodels.tsa.statespace.sarimax import SARIMAX
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller
from statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_acf, plot_pacf

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('Time_Series_Temp_Data.csv', parse_dates=['date'], index_col='date')

# Check for stationarity
result = adfuller(data['temperature'])  # Replace 'temperature' with your column name
print('ADF Statistic:', result[0])
print('p-value:', result[1])

# Differencing if necessary
if result[1] > 0.05:
    data['temperature'] = data['temperature'].diff().dropna()

# Plot ACF and PACF for parameter identification
plot_acf(data['temperature'].dropna())
plot_pacf(data['temperature'].dropna())
plt.show()

# Fit SARIMAX model (replace p, d, q, P, D, Q, s with identified values)
model = SARIMAX(data['temperature'], order=(p, d, q), seasonal_order=(P, D, Q, s))  # Replace with actual values
model_fit = model.fit()

# Summary of model
print(model_fit.summary())

# Forecasting future values
forecast_steps = 10  # Number of periods to forecast
forecast = model_fit.forecast(steps=forecast_steps)
print(forecast)

# Plotting forecasted values
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.plot(data.index[-50:], data['temperature'].tail(50), label='Historical Data')
plt.plot(pd.date_range(start=data.index[-1], periods=forecast_steps + 1)[1:], forecast, label='Forecast', color='red')
plt.title('Temperature Forecast')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Temperature')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# Conclusion
  The SARIMAX model provides a robust framework for analyzing and forecasting time series data like temperature readings. By following a systematic approach—checking for 
  stationarity, identifying parameters, fitting the model, and evaluating its performance—you can derive valuable insights and predictions from your dataset. This 
  methodology is essential in fields such as meteorology and climate science where accurate forecasting is crucial for decision-making.
