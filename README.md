# Time-Series-SARIMAX-Model
The SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors) model is an extension of the ARIMA model that incorporates seasonal effects and external variables. It is particularly useful for time series data that exhibit seasonal patterns and trends, making it suitable for applications such as temperature forecasting.
